# A Hybrid Quantum Autoencoder (HQA)

This repository contains simulations and research performed at the University of Melbourne in 2020. 
The work presented here has been re-structured to emphasise the work performed in introducing the Hybrid Quantum 
Autoencoder. This was the specific section of research that has subsequently been written for publication. Hence, 
the repository contains additional code that may seem to have no purpose in the construction of the HQA. 
We have attempted to reduce cluttering with one requiring to analyse the HQA.py for the implementation and
testing of the HQA.
